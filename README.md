# AnomalyDetectorPowerBI
The purpose of this project was to learn to train models inside a Business Intelligence tool

Although I have made very basic data vizzes to understand the resultant data 

I have used python script and pycaret package to train the model in PowerBI and the model used is 'iForest'

By default it uses K-nearest
